        <h1>Search Engines 3.0</h1>

        <h3>Gen 1 (Google)</h3>
        <p>Traditional search engines where users input a query and receive a list of links to relevant web pages. Users must sift through these links to find the information they need.</p>

        <h3>Gen 2 (Perplexity)</h3>
        <p>Search engines that provide a summarized answer to a query by analyzing the top links.</p>
        <p>This approach reduces the time users spend reading through multiple sources, offering concise information directly.</p>

        <h3>Gen 3 (Agentic Systems)</h3>
        <p>Advanced search engines that not only provide answers but also perform complex reasoning to gather information from multiple sources.</p>
        <p>These engines might use techniques like natural language understanding, web scraping, and integration of various data points to deliver a precise answer.</p>
        <p>An example: Asking how many essays Paul Graham has written since "Hackers & Painters" was published. Such a search engine would:</p>
        <pre><code>- determine the publication date of "Hackers & Painters"
- navigate Paul Graham's website or other relevant sources
- count the essays published since that date</code></pre>
        <p>This progression shows how search engines are becoming more sophisticated in understanding context and providing specific, detailed answers to complex queries.</p>
